# BrainStormEra_WPF - Windows Desktop Application

## Overview

**BrainStormEra_WPF** is a Windows desktop application built using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework. This application serves as the user interface component for the broader **BrainStormEra** project. This document provides an overview of the high-level architecture, key components, and functionality of the application.

For detailed information about the MVVM architecture implementation, see **MVVM Architecture**. For a comprehensive breakdown of the application's key components, see **Key Components**.

## Project Purpose

**BrainStormEra_WPF** provides a graphical user interface that enables users to interact with the **BrainStormEra** system. As a WPF application, it follows the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architectural pattern to maintain a clean separation of concerns between presentation logic and business logic.

## System Architecture Overview

The application follows a standard **MVVM** architecture pattern commonly used in WPF applications. This architecture consists of three primary layers:

1. **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
2. **View**: Represents the user interface elements.
3. **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View.
4. ## Application Structure

The **BrainStormEra_WPF** application is structured according to standard WPF patterns, with the following major components:

- **Data Layer**
- **Business Logic Layer**
- **Presentation Layer**

### Key Files:

- **App.xaml / App.xaml.cs**: Entry point for the application.
- **MainWindow.xaml**: Main user interface window for the application.
- **Views**: Contains the user interface views.
- **ViewModels**: Contains the logic that binds the views to the data model.
- **Models**: Represents the data used in the application.
- **Commands**: Contains the application commands to trigger actions.
- **Services**: Handles communication with the backend.
